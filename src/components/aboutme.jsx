                        I'm an alumni of Purdue University, where I receieved my Bachelors of Science in 
                        Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity and Software Engineering Coursework. While I've 
                        been coding since I was 14, my interest in Computer Science as a career path was 
                        sparked through my participation in competitive high school robotics, where 
                        in 2021 I was elected as the lead of software. Between 2019-2021, I could usually 
                        be found carrying an old Dell laptop around the robotics shop, working with experienced
                        and aspiring engineers from a variety of fields. Fast forward to today, I plan to spend 
                        my 20's mastering as many programming mediums and tools as possible, so that whenever an interesting 
                        project comes to my mind, I can sit down and create it.
